## Introduction

Welcome to the exploratory data analysis of sales data from an electronics shop specializing in products such as laptops, phones, fridges, etc. The electronics industry is dynamic and rapidly evolving, with new products and technologies constantly entering the market. For an electronics shop to thrive in this competitive landscape, it's crucial to gain insights into customer preferences, product demand, and sales patterns. In this notebook, we will dive into the dataset to understand sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. We aim to uncover actionable insights that can inform strategic decisions and drive business growth.

## Project Scope

The objective of this project is to dive into the large sales dataset to extract valuable insights. We will explore sales trends over time, identify the best-selling products, calculate revenue metrics such as total sales, and create visualizations to present our findings effectively. We will use Python for exploring and cleaning the data, and Tableau to build a dashboard of the cleaned data.

## Data Preparation

An understanding of the data coupled with problem understanding will help us in cleaning and preparing our data for analysis. It is usually rare to acquire ready-to-use data for any analysis without some level of preparation. To prepare our data, we normally assess the quality of the data, cleanse, format, blend, and sample the data. These issues may include:

* **Missing values:** Column values are incomplete.
* **Incorrect data:** Unexpected values for the column name.
* **Inconsistent values:** Values fall outside the expected range.
* **Duplicate values:** Duplicate entries.
* **Inconsistent data type:** Values entered in the columns are inconsistent with the column names.

To properly prepare our data for analysis, we will perform two important tasks:
* Part I: Data Quality Assessment
* Part II: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

### Part I: Data Quality Assessment

Here, we will assess the quality of the data to determine if it is ready for analysis. We will inspect for missing values, duplicated values, wrong data types, outliers, and more.

### Part II: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

During the data quality assessment, we identified a few data quality issues including unwanted data, inconsistent values, etc. In this task, we will perform all the initial data cleaning and preprocessing needed to produce data that will be suitable for our analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualisation

We are going to perform statistical analysis on the data to answer a few questions and create visualizations to get a pictorial understanding of the data.

Questions to be answered include:

1. What is the total sales in the year 2019 and 2020?
2. Which month in the year recorded the highest amount of sales?
3. Which product has the highest/lowest price?
4. Which product was the most/least purchased in each year?
5. What is the total quantity of items purchased?
6. Which city recorded the most/least sales?
7. Which day of the week has the most/least sales?
8. In which hour of the day do we experience more sales?

## Data Visualisation

We will build a dashboard in Power BI to visualize our cleaned dataset. Let's export the dataset and load it into Tableau for the dashboard.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Below are insights generated from the data and some recommended actions:

### Data Analysis Findings

- The data covers the year 2019.
- The average quantity ordered is approximately 1.12.
- The average price per item is around $184.39.
- The average sales amount is about $185.48.
- The most common hour for orders is around 3 PM (Hour 15).
- The total sales made over the period is $34,483,365.68.
- In 2019, December had the highest sales of $4,613,443.34 while January had the lowest sale amount of $1,813,586.44.
- The most expensive product is Macbook Pro Laptop selling at $1,700.00 and the least expensive product is AAA Batteries (4-pack) selling at $2.99.
- 209,079 quantities of products were sold in total with AAA Batteries (4-pack) selling the most quantity at 31,017 and LG Dryer being the least bought with 646 quantities sold.
- The top-selling products by revenue are:
  - Macbook Pro Laptop: $8,035,900.00
  - iPhone: $4,792,900.00
  - ThinkPad Laptop: $4,127,958.72
  - Google Phone: $3,318,600.00
  - 27in 4K Gaming Monitor: $2,434,707.57
- San Francisco generated the highest sales followed by Los Angeles and New York.
- Tuesday had the highest overall sales, implying that more products are bought on Tuesdays.
- December generated more sales weekly compared to the other months.
- There is a clear hourly trend in sales, with the highest sales occurring during the late morning and early evening hours.

### Recommendations

- Stakeholders should invest more during the final quarter of the year to attract more sales.
- AAA Batteries (4-pack) being the cheapest product, had the maximum quantity sold out. More of this product should be restocked in the shop to increase purchases from customers.
- Stakeholders should invest more in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York. These cities should be considered for the opening of new branches.
- From the insights generated, Tuesday made the highest sales of $5,087,956.78 followed by Wednesday, Sunday, and so on. Stakeholders can invest accordingly.
- The shop should be open and available in the late mornings and early evenings of the day to attend to all incoming orders.
- Hours with low sales can be targeted for specific marketing strategies or promotions to boost sales during those periods.
